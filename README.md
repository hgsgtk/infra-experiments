# Infrastructure Experiments

A collection of experimental projects exploring various infrastructure patterns, configurations, and technologies. This repository serves as a sandbox for testing and validating infrastructure concepts before implementing them in production environments.

## Overview

This repository contains experimental infrastructure projects that explore:

- **Database scaling patterns** (MySQL sharding, replication)
- **High availability configurations**
- **Performance optimization techniques**
- **Infrastructure as Code patterns**
- **Monitoring and observability setups**

## Projects

### MySQL Shards

The `mysql-shards/` directory contains experiments related to MySQL database sharding patterns and configurations.

**Status**: In development

**Focus Areas**:
- Horizontal sharding strategies
- Shard key selection and distribution
- Cross-shard query optimization
- Data consistency across shards
- Failover and recovery mechanisms
